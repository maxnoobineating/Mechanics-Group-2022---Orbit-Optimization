# Mechanics-Group-2022---Orbit-Optimization
<p>IT MAY TAKES A LONG TIME TO RUN!</p>
<p>python versions: 3.9.6 </p>
<p>
dependency:
numpy, scipy, matplotlib, numba</p>
<p></p>
<p>
To use, put the three files in the same directory, then execute orb_body.py, all the parameters can be tweaked at the bottom of orb_control.py</p>
<p></p>
<p>
further improvement is being made on altomating global minimum finder (step-up scaling of fidelity to escape local minimum), streamlining generation of data for different spacecrafts, and inclusion of some kind of data writer...</p>
